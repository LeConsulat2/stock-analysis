      "- **Fluctuating Revenue**: The declining revenues suggest volatility in market demand or pricing pressures, leading to potential cash flow issues in future periods.\n",

      "#### 1. Major Trend Analysis\n",
      "The 5-year price history of 066570.KS reveals significant fluctuations with an overall downtrend. Prices have fallen from a peak of approximately 143,636 KRW in early 2021 to the current price of about 85,100 KRW. The stock has experienced multiple price surges and corrections, reflecting volatility commonly found in tech stocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Support and Resistance Levels\n",
      "- **Support Level:** 82,300 KRW\n",
      "- **Resistance Level:** 113,700 KRW\n",
      "\n",
      "These levels indicate key price points where the stock has historically shown reactions. The support level represents a potential buying opportunity, while the resistance level indicates where selling pressure may increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Volume Analysis\n",
      "Recent volume trends indicate an upward movement, which is a positive signal. Increasing volume during rising prices suggests that buying interest is building. In contrast, volume has decreased in correlation with recent price decline, indicating potential weakness in the trend. Monitoring volume levels will be crucial for validating any future price movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Technical Indicator Signals\n",
      "- **Current Price:** 85,100 KRW\n",
      "- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 32.27, indicating that the stock is in an oversold condition. An RSI below 30 typically signals that the stock could rebound, suggesting potential upward price action.\n",
      "- **Volume Trend:** The volume trend is up, which supports the possibility of a future price reversal if buying pressure continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Although 066570.KS has shown significant price volatility over the past five years, the current analysis highlights critical support and resistance levels. The oversold condition reflected by the RSI suggests a potential for price recovery. Monitoring upcoming volume trends will provide further insights into the stock's movement, as increasing buying activity could signal a reversal of the current downtrend.\n",
